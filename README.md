PiControl
=========

PiControl is a framework that enables execution of a process control loop on a raspberry pi. 
We use it to balance a pole on a car with two wheels (similar to a Segway).

Execution of the control loop is done in Servo. The Terminal command allows interaction
with the Servo. The interaction is based on parameters that have been stored in an
alternating buffer in shared memory.
